# eComm-FullStack (Frontend)
*Frontend repo built using React/Redux*
---

### Purpose for this app?
Initially to play around with using Strapi.io's CMS and auto-generated APIs on the backend. I also wanted to interact with the data so I decided to build a react frontend and I will utilize Redux for state management(eventually.lol) 

### Technology Used
MongoDB
NodeJS
Strapi
React
Redux
Bootstrap 4

### Installation

Clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/KenIjiwoye/ecomm-fullstack-frontend.git`

Run `yarn install` or `npm install`

I also used a proxy in `package.json` to point to my backend server: `"proxy": "http://localhost:1337`

## TODO
- Finish Reviews resources
- Install & setup Redux
